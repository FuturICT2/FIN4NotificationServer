		<h3>Welcome to the FIN4Notifications Server</h3>
		<div>
			Here you can subscribe by email to smart contract events emitted from the FIN4Xplorer application.<br>
			If share only your email address, you can subscribe to events addressed to anyone. If you furthermore<br>
			supply your Ethereum public address, you can subscribe to events specificially for your account.<br><br>
			<small><i>
				Note that one cornerstone of the web3 in general and one of our basic design principals is, that users<br>
				of FIN4Xplorer don't have to expose anything from themselves other then their public address. Any link<br>
				to your idendity beyond that, has to happen voluntarily and after explicit consent. When you supply your<br>
				email address <b>and</b> your Ethereum public address here, you are trading the convenience of receiving<br>
				notifications while not being on the site, with establishing a link between your blockchain idendity and<br>
				your email address. Of course, that info lives only on our server, you can unsubscribe at any time and<br>
				we are on the Rinkeby testnet for now. But servers can be hacked and log files stick around. You are<br>
				most welcome to use this service (that's why we built it), we just want to make sure you understand the<br>
				implications of doing so.
